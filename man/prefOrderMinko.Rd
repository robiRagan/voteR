\usage{
prefOrderMinko(
  idealsMatrix,
  altsMatrix,
  minkoOrderVector,
  salienceMatrix,
  lossOrderVector
)
}
\arguments{
\item{idealsMatrix}{A numberVoters x numberDimensions matrix of numerics.
Each row is a voter and each column is a dimension in the policy space,
<d1,d2,...dn>. The values in a given row give the location of one voters
ideal point, the point that is the argMax of their utility
function.Example: In a two dimensional space the if entry in the matrix at
location (v=2,d1=2,d=2) is <.5,.5> then the peak of voter 2's utility
function in the two dimensional issue space is at .5,.5.}

\item{altsMatrix}{A numberAlts x numberDimensions matrix of numerics. Each
row is an alternative and each column is a dimension in the policy space,
<d1,d2,...dn>. The values in a given row give the location of that
alternative in the policy space. Example: In a two dimensional space the
if entry in the matrix at location (d=2,d1=2,d=2) is <.25,.75> then the
location of that alternative in the two dimensional issue space is at
.25,.75.}

\item{minkoOrderVector}{A numVoters lengh vector of doubles. It is the ``order" 
of the Minkowski Distance being used. In this packge it should be an 
element of [1,100]. Examples for cases where the salience on all 
dimensions is equal: 1 = Manhattan Distance.  diamond shaped indifference
curves, perfect substitutes. 2 = Euclidian Distance. If salience on all
dimensions is equal, circular indifference curves. 100 = Aproximates
Chebyshev Distance. If salience on all dimensions is equal square
indifference curves, perfect compliments.}

\item{salienceMatrix}{A matrix of doubles that is numberOfDimensions long: 
<sd1, sd2, sd3, ... sdk>. Each element of the vector represents the 
*relative* saliance of each dimension for a voter. The dimension with the 
lowest salience serves as the "numeraire" dimension and should recieve a 
salience of 1. All the other saliences are expressed in units of this 
"numeraire". So if a dimension is twice as important to a voter as the 
numeraire dimension it recieves a salience of 2. Example: The second row
is 1 2 3. This means that for voter two (second row) the salience of dimension 1 is the
numeraire, dimension 2 is twice as saient as dimension 1 and
dimension 3 is three times as salient as dimension one.}

\item{lossOrderVector}{A numVoters lengh vector of doubles. It is the ``order" 
of the loss function being used. In short the Minkowski Distance is the way that
a voter percieves the distance between their ideal point and another alternative. 
The loss function tells us how that distance is converted into utility for the voter. 
If lossOrderVector=1, then the voter has linear loss and their disutility for an
alternative is equal to the minkowski distance. If lossOrderVector=2 then the voter has
a quadratic loss function and their disutility is the square of the minkowski distance.
This has the effect of causing utility to fall slowly at first as they evaluate alternatives
closer to their ideal, but then once an alternative is sufficently far away utility falls much
faster than in teh quadratic case.}

\value{
prefMatrix A numVoters x numAlts matrix that contains the Minkowski
  Utility between each voter and each alternative, given a voter's salience, 
  Minkowski order and loss function. The sailence, Minkowski order and loss function
  together determine a voter's utility function.
